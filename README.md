# pdfnamer 

I am an academic. I read a lot. Most of what I read these days comes in the form of a pdf file. I just can't manage to keep my pdfs sorted or appropriately named. Where is that article from last week? I can't find it. I will download it again.

Yes, there are many existing tools for keeping pdfs organised and in line with one's method of keeping track of bibliographical details. But I don't control how these work. And I don't like how many of these work. There must be a better way. 

The aim of `pdfnamer` is to automate the process of renaming pdfs as much as
possible.
